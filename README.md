## ðŸ“¦ Project description

This is an Android application for the Mobile Computing and Cloud Computing exam of Sapienza University MSc degree in Engineering in Computer Science.
The project was carried out with the intent of building a cloud-based mobile application, making use of device sensors, image processing and external APIs.
Several tools were used in the development process, including JetPack Compose, Android Studio, Google Firebase Cloud, Google Places API and the Kotlin language.


## ðŸ§­ How to use it

Once signed in, the user may search for a place or location i.e. the Colosseum. Once selected from the list, a new screen is displayed with the camera view, asking the user to turn around and tap when confident enough to be looking at the selected place. Finally the user is credited with points depending on how close it got to the target. A button is presented to restart the process for other places.
The app also includes a Leaderboard tab showcasing the top ranked players all over the world and a profile tab where the user can edit its personal info, log out or even delete its account.
